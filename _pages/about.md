I'm currently a third-year PhD student at [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/),
[Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), studying computer science.
I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Yi Wu](https://jxwuyi.weebly.com/).
Prior to this, I received my BEng degree from the
[Department of Electric Engineering](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2021.

My research interests lie in the intersection of reinforcement learning (RL) and distributed systems.
Currently, I focus on developing efficient distributed systems for large-scale DRL/MARL/RLHF applications.

I'd describe myself more as a programmer than a researcher.

I enjoy coding, cooking, and music (Jay Chou, funk, Jazz, and J-POP).
